What is Polkadoge (PDOG)?

Polkadoge is a world changing, multi-platform cross-chain Dogecoin that also just so happens to pump out the dopest stickers in the game.

It’s a dog eat dog world out there and Polkadoge is positioning itself to become the new Alpha. They have clearly separated themselves from the pack by becoming the first cross-chain Dogecoin in all of crypto…. and they’re not just riding the doggy hype train, either… Polkadoge set themselves up for a long future because they were founded upon a fully transparent, community-funded fair launch and built an innovative rewards system into their token that will ensure every little Polkadoggy can win… not just those lucky few pups who were “early”.

Every PDOG trade and transaction generates a 4% fee that feeds right back into the Polkadoge ecosystem
2% - distributed proportionally to all Polkadoge holders
2% - added to the liquidity pool

But… it sure doesn’t hurt to be early!! In anticipation of the Moonriver and Moonbeam chain genesis, Polkadoge is running an additional promotional airdrop. Thousands of dollars in PDOG tokens will be airdropped for free to all PDOG holders and LP providers when Mooriver and Moonbeam launch. The more you hodl, the more you provide, the longer you hodl … the more sweet, sweet PDOG you’ll receive.
